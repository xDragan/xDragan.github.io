  I’m an extended reality (VR, AR, MR) and videogame developer interested in programming(C/C/C++) and design. I’m open to keeping learning and improving as a developer and working on new projects in the years to come, especially those whose main objective is to help people in healthcare.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Developing,</mark>  <mark>Programming</mark> and <mark>Designing</mark> games and experiences.
  
  I have worked developing using Oculus, HTC, Vuforia, ARFoundation, OpenGL, SDL, Box2D, Bullet, Recast and developed games or experiences with it (listed below);
